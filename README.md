### Hola!

My name is **Ilia Domyshev** and this is my GitHub profile which I use for personal needs.
I have another one for my job, but activity there is private.

* I work full-day as a Full-Stack developer since september 2020 until NOW 

* Previously I worked as system administrator for many years from june 2008, when I was graduated as mathematician-programmer
  
* I'm crazy about JavaScript as a language which is so powerfull because is so simple!

* I really LOVE NodeJS and NPM infrastructure

* At university time I used to use PHP most of all for backend and also loved it for simplicity, despite on fact that I don't use PHP anymore in my projects I will always LOVE it as my childhood language
  
* I started learning LINUX at university time and still do it, but now I also like MAC OS as well!

* My top-level framework for frontend is VUE 3, for backend is EXPRESS, thanks to creators of both!

* Thanks SteppeChange for my job where I found myself as a programmer
